# Insurance Interest Prediction – Machine Learning Model

This project is the first machine learning model I developed as part of my graduation project.  
The objective of the model is to determine whether a user is interested in applying for an insurance product by analyzing various input features. This is achieved using a supervised machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a user applying for an insurance product based on behavioral and demographic data.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The system analyzes user data and classifies each user into:
- ✅ Interested
- ❌ Not Interested

The project allowed me to practice:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Handling missing/imbalanced data  
- Training and evaluating ML classification models  
- Comparing algorithms and tuning hyperparameters  
- Exporting the final model for production use

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
(Model selection based on accuracy/F1-score)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for analysis)

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high prediction accuracy suitable for real-world lead scoring.
